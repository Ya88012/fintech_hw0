## Problem 1

### Explain the mechanism of gas on the blockchain, and outline the purpose of EIP-1559, specifying the problem it addresses and solves.

Gas on the blockchain refers to the unit of measurement used to calculate the computational effort required to execute operations or transactions on the blockchain network. In Ethereum, for instance, gas is used to determine the fees users must pay to execute smart contracts or transfer tokens. Every operation on the Ethereum network consumes a certain amount of gas, and users must pay for this gas in Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. Gas prices are dynamic and are determined by market demand and network congestion. When the network is busy, gas prices tend to rise as users compete to have their transactions processed faster. Conversely, during periods of low activity, gas prices decrease.

EIP-1559 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559) is a significant upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain that was implemented in August 2021. It aims to address several issues related to gas fees, including fee predictability, user experience, mitigating network congestion, burning of base fees, and so on.
Overall, EIP-1559 aims to make the Ethereum network more efficient, predictable, and sustainable while also addressing some of the scalability and usability challenges associated with gas fees.

## Problem 2

### Review the Solidity documentation to enhance your understanding of storage layout, and illustrate the storage structure of the provided contract - gist. In your report, provide the storage slot for each state variable (Preferred format: var1 - slot 0, ...). If a variable does not occupy any storage slot, please use X.

* var1 => slot 0
* var2 => slot 1
* var3 => slot 2
* var4 => slot 3
* var5 => slot 3
* var6 => slot 3
* var7 => slot 4
* var8 => X

## Problem 3

### Explain impermanent loss in Automated Market Maker (AMM), detailing the issue, and provide an illustrative example.

Impermanent loss occurs when the price of the assets changes after the liquidity provider has deposited them into the pool. It refers to the temporary loss of funds that liquidity providers may experience when they provide liquidity to a pool, compared to simply holding the assets themselves. If the price of one asset rises significantly compared to the other, the liquidity provider's share of that asset within the pool decreases, leading to a loss compared to simply holding the assets.

The issue arises because liquidity providers must deposit pairs of assets into a liquidity pool to facilitate trading. These pools use a constant product formula to determine the exchange rate between the two assets. When one asset's price changes relative to the other, the pool rebalances itself to maintain this constant product, effectively buying low and selling high.

Here's an illustrative example:

Let's say a liquidity provider deposits $1,000 worth of ETH and $1,000 worth of DAI into a liquidity pool with a 50/50 ratio. This means they contribute a total liquidity of $2,000.

After depositing, the price of ETH increases by 50%. Now, the liquidity provider's share of ETH in the pool is worth $1,500, while their share of DAI remains at $1,000.

If the liquidity provider were to withdraw their funds at this point, they would have $2,500 worth of assets in total (consisting of $1,500 worth of ETH and $1,000 worth of DAI). However, if they had simply held onto their original $1,000 worth of ETH and $1,000 worth of DAI, they would have had $2,000.

So, despite the increase in the total value of the pool, the liquidity provider experiences impermanent loss of $500 because their share of the assets in the pool changed due to price movements.

It's important to note that impermanent loss is only realized if the liquidity provider decides to withdraw their funds from the pool. If they continue to provide liquidity, the loss remains "impermanent" as it fluctuates with changes in asset prices.
